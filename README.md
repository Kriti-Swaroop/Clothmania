# Clothmania
The implementation of the project is done by extensive use of file handling and structures in C language.
The code first asks the user to log in or sign up. As the user logs in or signs up, they are asked what category (men/women) of clothing do they wish to browse or if they wish to see the cart or if they want to exit the program. When the user chooses any category,the various types of clothing available in that section are shown.
The program specifies the brand, the cost, the size and a detailed description of all the items in the searched type of clothing.The user can choose the clothing item they wish to purchase with the size they wish to wear and add it to their personal cart. Users can buy any number of clothes they wish to buy and add them to their cart. The total cost of all the items in the cart would be shown at the end of the cart.The user is also able to delete any item from the cart by specifying the serial number of that item.
